Analysis of the road safety data of the UK

In this project, we analyze the 2015 road safety data of the UK, which are about the circumstances of road accidents, the types of vehicles involved, and the consequential casualties. We try to use the data to answer some interesting questions regarding car accidents. The data sets are available [here](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data). The analysis is in the file `road.ipynb`.
